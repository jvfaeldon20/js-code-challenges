// Try to make the solution to this problem as efficiently as possible. 
// Consider using loops that would allow you to type the fewest characters/commands. 
// While you could simply print the even numbers, get creative and see how you could 
// output them in a way that would work up to 10 or even up to 10,000 with little extra effort.
